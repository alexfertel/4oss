# 4oss.tv

Your friendly telescope into the world of open‑source websites.

## How It Works

1. Pulls a curated list of open‑source applications from the [opensource‑observer/oss‑directory](https://github.com/opensource−observer/oss−directory).
2. For each site, generates a screenshot via [Urlbox](https://urlbox.com/) so you can preview before diving in.
3. On every click, we pick a different entry.

Screenshots Sponsored by Urlbox

Urlbox is the most mature and accurate [website screenshot API](https://urlbox.com/screenshot-api). Turn any URL or HTML document into pixel-perfect images, PDFs or video. Remove banners, popups and other ugly glitches. You can even extract data and text at the same time.
